Math Flash Cards App

The purpose of this app is to give children a place to practice early math skills through simple addition equations in on flash cards. It is intended to be used by a child and an adult with the adult checking answers and marking which cards the child has gotten correct.

User stories:
As a user, I want to see a clean interface that doesn't distract from the cards I'm learning from.
As a user, I want to be able to scroll through and flip cards with either a mouse or the keyboard.
As a user, I want to be able to record which cards I've gotten correct and which I'm missed.
As a user, I want to have the cards I've missed presented to me again after I've reached the end of the pile.
As a user, I want to know when I've correctly answered all of the cards in the pile.
As a user, I want to be able to reset the score and card pile to begin again.

Major hurdles:
I started this project with an equations array and an answers array. That setup made things very difficult to accomplish the scoring and changing the card borders to green as a visual representation of correctness. Towards the end of the project an instructor guided me to changing my data setup to a single array of objects that made the all of the required functions much easier to accomplish.

Unsolved problems:
When using the reset button I am able to get everything back to starting conditions, but the green border stays on for the first card in the deck until navigated away from it and back.
